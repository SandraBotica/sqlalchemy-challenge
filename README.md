In the SurfsUp folder you will find:
1. climate_starter.ipynb
    This jupyter notebook file contains:
    Part 1: An analysis and exploration of the climate data including the Precipitation and Station anlysis.
2. app.py
    This python file is the design of the climate app.
3. app.ipynb
    This jupyter notebook file contains my checks on the cliamte app script I had written as a trial, when I was finding errors in the app.py.

I have done my best to also address the marking key expectations from bootcampspot, including:
    1. Coding conventions and formatting.
    2. Deployment and submission
    3. Comments.

Enjoy marking this assignment/challenge.
